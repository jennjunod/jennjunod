**Bio**

I believe developer relations make great products pop. I specialize in making technology human — enabling developers to understand, adopt, and adore technical products. My work in content marketing, partnerships, and community building allows me to improve brand visibility, position companies and leaders within the industry, and widen the adoption of products and services.

Whether I’m solving problems through code, sharing knowledge with others, or sparking conversations on Teach Jenn Tech or Shit2TalkAbout, I am a passionate advocate for social justice in the tech industry, striving to create inclusive spaces where everyone feels heard.I believe developer relations make great products pop.
